    <h2>Testimony</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Shanghai, a vibrant city focused on practical innovation and relentless improvement. However, God was not part of the picture. Dogmatic practicality meant I took atheism for granted, thinking that the question of God had little pragmatic worth, unlike education, which shed light on practical issues.</p>
    <p>My father dropped out of a prestigious college to care for his aging parents. A few years later, I was born, and he once again chose family by spending time with me over pursuing a higher education for himself. Therefore, I internalized how my father’s love for me manifested in practical choices and wanted to fulfill the educational journey my father never had a chance to complete. My great-grandma was a Christian. Though illiterate, her tremendous investment in Christianity propelled her diligent work to send all three of her children to college, including my grandma. Meanwhile, the lack of intellectual roots for her belief in Christianity meant that no one else in my family shared her Christian beliefs. I saw education as a way to share our convictions with others. From attending the best schools to studying abroad in Italy for two years, that same intellectual drive propelled me to take a diversity of classes in high school and pursue computer science, economics, and business administration here at UC Berkeley.</p>
    <p>However, as I deepened my intellectual roots, I felt less and less connected to other people. The tremendous beauty of economics in quantifying human decision-making and analyzing choices was a substitute for social interactions. I focused on intellectual conversations and scholarly exchanges at the expense of broader and more casual relationships. I even developed rigorous criteria for evaluating my relationships through the narrow lens of their intellectual merits.</p>
    <p>There came a time, however, when I realized my intellectual journey led to my spiritual journey. My exploration of art history led to a fascination with a profusion of Christian symbols, artworks, and even gothic churches. My exploration of philosophy led me to question the purpose of life and the ultimate reason for my existence. My exploration of economics led me to consider how people’s fundamental values inform their decisions and how these values came into being. All these seem to nudge me to reconsider the question of God. I started reading about Christianity independently, but reading the Bible seemed daunting, whereas internet sources appeared unreliable.</p>
    <p>This all changed when I took Course 101 in my first semester of college, which delivered clarity and insight, helping me understand the significance of Christianity. While I found God’s existence credible, I was hesitant to accept the claims as truth beyond a reasonable doubt. With the abundance of conflicting information, the tendency for humans to sin and deceive, and the long time that has elapsed since the resurrection, it felt impossible to ascertain anything with absolute certainty. Therefore, my mentor and I circled back and forth with incessant apologetic questions and debated the authenticity of evidence for God.</p>
    <p>My commitment to truth and education was both a blessing and a burden. While it helped me encounter Christianity, it also prevented me from taking anything for granted. In October last year, I brought this quandary to Ray and realized three things. First, Christianity is fundamentally a relationship with Jesus, and even with the most committed of relationships, some extent of ambiguity and uncertainty is inevitable. I realized I needed a high level of confidence, but not absolute certainty, as long as I am committed to the ongoing humble pursuit of truth. Secondly, I realized my commitment to one narrow definition of truth as reliable scholarly knowledge led me to miss the greater truth (which is Jesus Christ), and He was waiting for me to discover and commit to Him. Above all, I understood that Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross and resurrection meant the revival of relationships. It was the tremendous act of love that washed away my sins and the reincarnation of me with the new identity of being the son of God. It was the turning of a new page in my journey, now as a member of the body of Christ and embracing that as the center of my life. Moreover, it meant a commitment to love and nurture those around me, nourishing relationships with fellow brothers and sisters in the same way Jesus had for me.</p>
    <p>On October 10, 2021, I heartily embraced Jesus as my Savior and Lord, glorifying His sacrifice and the forgiveness of my sins and devoting Him to be the authority of my life. I am tremendously grateful for all those who propelled my spiritual journey and the various serendipities that God has arranged for me to discover Him as the creator and righteous master of the universe. God continues to illuminate my path forward, endowing in me the clarity and strength to live life as a faithful Christian.</p>

    <h1>Academic Interests</h1>
    <p>Hi! I graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in Computer Science, Economics, and Business Administration. My vision is to help people make better decisions, informed by concepts like Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, or Mulhern’s First Law. Inspired by my experience working at the Student Learning Center as a tutor for Econ 140 (Econometrics), I envision a community of collaborative growth, whereby we empower and uplift one another through thoughtful engagement, supportive camaraderie, and a deep knowledge of theory. I believe students must be given the appropriate resources in order to succeed, so I am committed to supporting excellence in learning by drawing interdisciplinary yet personalized connections, transforming the learning experience into an active journey, and providing students with the motivation and tools to prosper.</p>

What personal and moral foundations contribute to such an ideological divide? More importantly, what do these understanding mean for ourselves, our communities, and our democracy?</p>

        <p>This is a research project looking at the outcomes of a specific surgical practice used to treat epilepsy. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often experience frequent and unpredictable seizures. When these symptoms cannot be controlled by medication alone, some patients seek out surgical options. Our study found that these patients experience different levels of verbal memory loss depending on whether their surgery was on the left side or right side of the brain.</p>
